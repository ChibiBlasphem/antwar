Any Graphic Designers should probably get all of their laughter out of the way while they can. The cold, hard truth is; typography on the web stinks. Let’s take a look at today’s workflow. We’re going to design a website.

Unless I want to use Verdana, Georgia, Times New Roman, or Arial, my type choices are pretty much restricted to those available through a number of services. There’s Typekit, which is owned by Adobe and, well, smells like Adobe; Fontdeck, which is admittedly not exactly a painless service due to it’s pay-per-font restrictions which only work for corporations who are unlikely to flex on their typographic choices; Google Fonts, which—though comprehensive—is severely lacking in both features and quality; H&Co.’s Cloud.Typography1, which has perhaps the best catalogue, though is out of many people’s budget and comes with a performance penalty (500kb is about as small as you’ll get for a good pairing from H&Co.); Adobe web fonts, which is basically just Typekit/Google Fonts on Adoberoids; a multitude of other options which are either too expensive or have far too high technical constraints and payloads; and, last but not least, self-hosting. Don’t even get me started on the complexities and caveats of self-hosting.

That’s a lot of choices. Are we having fun yet?
